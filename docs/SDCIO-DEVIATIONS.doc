A deviation is a report indicating differences between the actual device or system configuration and the configuration specified in one or more Config CRs managed by SDC.

In Browfield Env, all the deviations with target type, are pre-exiting configurations in the network elements. Those are marked as UNHANDLED. They can not be managed. However, you can create a new Intent overwriting those values.

```bash
NAMESPACE   NAME                                             TYPE     TARGET                        DEVIATIONS
nok-bng     deviation.config.sdcio.dev/clab-sros-bngt-agg    target   nok-bng/clab-sros-bngt-agg    332
nok-bng     deviation.config.sdcio.dev/clab-sros-bngt-bng1   target   nok-bng/clab-sros-bngt-bng1   517
nok-bng     deviation.config.sdcio.dev/clab-sros-bngt-bng2   target   nok-bng/clab-sros-bngt-bng2   519
nok-bng     deviation.config.sdcio.dev/clab-sros-bngt-core   target   nok-bng/clab-sros-bngt-core   308
```

If you have an intent:

```yaml
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: vprn-10020-sros-bng1
  namespace: nok-bng
  labels:
    config.sdcio.dev/targetName: clab-sros-bngt-bng1
    config.sdcio.dev/targetNamespace: nok-bng
spec:

  priority: 10
  revertive: false
  config:
  - path: /configure/service
    value:     
      vprn:
        service-name: "VPRN-DATA-10020"
        customer: "1"
        service-id: 10020
        admin-state: "enable"
```        

`revertive: false` indicates that any change on those values from the device will be reverted to the intent value, with no action.
I you use `revertive: true`, then those deviations will be shown as `NOT-APPLIED` and they need to be reverted removing the deviations (editig CR Config associated resource or just deleting it)


In Summary, there are three types of deviations:

UNHANDLED

- No matching Config CR exists in the system.
- Treated as a Target-type deviation.
- SDC only reports these deviations; no corrective action is taken.

NOT-APPLIED

- A matching Config CR exists, but the actual configuration differs from what is defined in the Config CR.
- SDC will act on these deviations based on the configured mode: revertive or non-revertive.

OVERRULED

- A matching Config CR exists, but the actual configuration has been overridden by a higher-priority intent.
- SDC reports these deviations but does not attempt to change the overriding configuration.

Additonally, you can build an extra option called `blame` for kubectl to indentify multiple `NOT-APPLIED` deviations at once to all the intents: https://github.com/sdcio/kubectl-sdcio
